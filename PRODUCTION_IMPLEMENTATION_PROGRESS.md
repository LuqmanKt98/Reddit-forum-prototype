```
reddit_communities: Community[]
reddit_votes: Vote[]
```

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

   - Login with credentials verification
   - Session persistence

2. **User Management**
   - User profiles with karma and roles
   - Role-based access control
   - User ban functionality
   - User promotion/demotion

3. **Data Persistence**
   - All data stored in localStorage
   - Automatic initialization with mock data
   - Data versioning for future migrations
   - Cross-tab event communication

4. **Custom Hooks**
   - Reusable localStorage hooks
   - CRUD operations for all entities
   - Automatic state synchronization

## üìã Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials
- [ ] Signup with new account
- [ ] Signup with duplicate username
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] Session persistence on page reload
- [ ] Demo account quick login
- [ ] Admin account access
- [ ] Moderator account access

## üîÑ Integration Points

The new authentication system is ready to integrate with:
- Post creation (requires current user)
- Comment creation (requires current user)
- Admin dashboard (requires admin role)
- User profiles (requires user lookup)
- Voting system (requires user tracking)

## üìà Performance Considerations

- localStorage operations are synchronous (acceptable for demo)
- Data is loaded on demand
- Custom hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Event system enables cross-component communication

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

- Consistent dark theme with glass-morphism
- Clear error messages and validation feedback
- Loading states for async operations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
