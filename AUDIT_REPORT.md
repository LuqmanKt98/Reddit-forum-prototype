## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)

### 1. **Navbar Not Updating After Login** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Issue**: After logging in, the navbar still shows "Login" button instead of user info
- **Root Cause**: Navbar component doesn't re-render when user logs in
- **Impact**: Users can't see they're logged in; confusing UX
- **Fix**: Add proper state management or use a context/provider pattern

### 2. **Theme Inconsistency** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- **Issue**: Create page, Admin page, and Comment section use light theme while home/login use dark theme
- **Impact**: Jarring visual experience; breaks design consistency
- **Fix**: Apply dark theme to all pages consistently
